## Understanding ci.yml file

The `ci.yml` file in the `.github/workflows/` directory defines the Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) workflow for the project_xyz template. This workflow automates testing, linting, and deployment processes whenever code is pushed or a pull request is made to the main branch.

### Workflow Structure

```yaml
name: CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.8'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install flake8 pytest mypy black isort
        if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi
    
    - name: Lint with flake8
      run: flake8 .
    
    - name: Check imports with isort
      run: isort --check-only .
    
    - name: Format with Black
      run: black --check .
    
    - name: Type check with mypy
      run: mypy .
    
    - name: Run tests
      run: pytest
    
    - name: Build package
      run: python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
    
    - name: Publish to PyPI
      if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
      uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
      with:
        user: __token__
        password: ${{ secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN }}
```

### Key Components

1. **Trigger Events**: The workflow runs on pushes and pull requests to the main branch.

2. **Job - build-and-test**: 
   - Runs on the latest Ubuntu environment.
   - Sets up Python 3.8.
   - Installs dependencies and development tools.
   - Performs linting (flake8), import sorting (isort), code formatting (Black), and type checking (mypy).
   - Runs the test suite with pytest.
   - Builds the package.
   - Publishes to PyPI if the event is a push to the main branch.

### Usage

1. Ensure this file is in your `.github/workflows/` directory.
2. Commit and push changes or create a pull request to the main branch to trigger the workflow.
3. For PyPI publishing, add your PyPI API token to the repository secrets as `PYPI_API_TOKEN`.

### Customization

You can modify this workflow by:
- Changing the Python version.
- Adding or removing linting/testing steps.
- Adjusting the conditions for the PyPI publish step.
- Including additional deployment or notification steps.

### Viewing Results

Access the workflow results in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository. Each run will show detailed logs and outcomes for all steps in the process.

This CI/CD configuration ensures consistent code quality and automates the release process for the project_xyz template.
