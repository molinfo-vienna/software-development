# Integration with GitHub Actions

Include steps in your GitHub Actions workflow to automate testing, building, and deploying your package to PyPI. This ensures that every release meets quality standards and simplifies the release process. In the next section, we will provide a detailed example of the GitHub Actions YAML configuration file that accomplishes this integration along with the previous best practices.


## GitHub Actions Workflow Example

Here's an example YAML configuration file for GitHub Actions, demonstrating how to incorporate linting, testing, type hinting, and packaging for a Python project. This file also shows how to automate the deployment of the package to PyPI using local runners.

```yaml
name: Python Package CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.8'
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install flake8 pytest pytest-cov mypy black bandit isort twine
        if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi
        
    - name: Lint with Flake8
      run: flake8 src/ tests/
      
    - name: Check import order with Isort
      run: isort --check-only src/ tests/
      
    - name: Format code with Black
      run: black --check src/ tests/
      
    - name: Security check with Bandit
      run: bandit -r src/
      
    - name: Type check with Mypy
      run: mypy src/
      
    - name: Run pytest
      run: pytest --cov=src tests/
      
    - name: Build package
      run: python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
      
    - name: Publish to PyPI
      if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && github.event_name == 'push'
      run: twine upload dist/*
      env:
        TWINE_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.PYPI_USERNAME }}
        TWINE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PYPI_PASSWORD }}

```

### Running the Workflow

To run this workflow, simply push changes to your `main` branch or create a pull request against it. The workflow will execute automatically, ensuring your code adheres to quality standards and is packaged correctly for distribution. Ensure that PyPI credentials (`PYPI_USERNAME` and `PYPI_PASSWORD`) are securely stored in your GitHub repository's secrets.

This comprehensive approach leverages GitHub Actions with local runners to maintain high standards in your Python project, automating testing, linting, security checks, type checking, and deployment to PyPI.

Let's break down the provided GitHub Actions workflow example for a Python project into more detailed steps. This should help new users understand how each part functions and what they might need to adjust based on their project's requirements.

### Detailed Explanation of Each Step in the Workflow:

1. **Workflow Triggers**:
   - **`on: push:`** and **`on: pull_request:`** specify that the workflow should start either when commits are pushed to the `main` branch or when a pull request is made to the `main` branch. This ensures that any code changes are automatically tested and deployed if they meet the specified conditions.

2. **Jobs - Build and Test**:
   - **`runs-on: self-hosted`**: This line specifies that the workflow should run on a self-hosted runner, not on GitHub's hosted runners. This means you must have a runner set up in your environment, which can be beneficial for performance, security, or usage of internal resources.

3. **Steps within the Job**:
   - **`actions/checkout@v2`**: This action checks out your repository under `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`, so your workflow can access it.
   - **`actions/setup-python@v2`**: Sets up a Python environment using Python 3.8. It's essential for Python-based projects to specify which Python version they are using to avoid compatibility issues.

4. **Dependency Installation**:
   - **Installing tools and packages**: The script upgrades `pip` and installs several packages (`flake8`, `pytest`, etc.) which are necessary for linting, testing, and other checks. 
   - **Project-specific dependencies**: If a `requirements.txt` file exists, it installs additional dependencies from there, which are specific to your project.

5. **Quality Assurance and Testing Steps**:
   - **Linting with Flake8**: Checks the code for style issues and programming errors.
   - **Checking import order with Isort**: Ensures that import statements are clean and sorted in a standard format.
   - **Code formatting with Black**: Validates that the code follows the uncompromising code style.
   - **Security checks with Bandit**: Scans code for common security issues.
   - **Type checking with Mypy**: Verifies type hints and type usage throughout the codebase.
   - **Running tests with pytest**: Executes unit tests and generates a coverage report to ensure functionality works as expected.

6. **Building the Package**:
   - **`python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`**: This command packages the project into a source distribution and a wheel. These files are what you would upload to a package index like PyPI.

7. **Conditional Deployment**:
   - **Publish to PyPI**: If the previous steps are successful and the push is made to the `main` branch, the workflow uses `twine` to upload the package to PyPI. This step uses environment variables (`TWINE_USERNAME` and `TWINE_PASSWORD`) stored in GitHub Secrets to securely authenticate to PyPI.

### Running the Workflow:

To make this workflow operational, push changes to your `main` branch or create a pull request against it. Ensure you have set up the necessary Python environment and have GitHub Secrets configured with your PyPI credentials for deployment.

### Customization Tips for New Users:

- **Python Version**: Adjust the `python-version` in the `setup-python` step according to your project’s requirements.
- **Dependencies**: Modify the list of installed tools in the dependency installation step based on your coding and testing practices.
- **Additional Testing or Building Steps**: You can add more steps, such as integration testing or Docker containerization, depending on your project’s complexity and deployment needs.
- **Environment Variables and Secrets**: Make sure you configure the required secrets in your GitHub repository settings to handle credentials safely.

By understanding each part of this workflow, you can effectively maintain high standards in your project, automating various checks and deployments efficiently.
