### Testing

Writing test while writing code is a good practice and makes you code more reliable and prone to failure or bugs.
Testing can be done with many different frameworks. Using the CMS cookiecutter, [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/) is integrated. But you can of course also use pythonâ€™s standard [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) module.

When writing tests, keep the following in mind:

* Each test unit should focus on a small functionality and prove it correct
* Each test unit should be independet of another one
* Make each test unit run fast and avoid unnecessary, redundant complex structures (only if really necessary)
* Each test unit should be run automatically on push operations
* Run your whole test suite before and after your work too check weather you introduced an error
* Use descriptiv names for your test units - as long as they briefly describe what is done - this differes from the often preferred shorter names in you source code
* Keep in mind: A test unit without purpose should be avoided
* When collaborating, looking and running unit tests can be quite helpful in the beginning to get an understanding of the code itself
