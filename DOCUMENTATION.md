# Documentation

If you want people to use your project and code, write proper documentation!
Start as soon as possible! 
Its more fun to produce code right away, but crucial to produce proper documentation as soon as possible. 
We would recommend filling up your README.md with what your project `can do`, `how to install` it, including `requirement files`, `how to use` it, `what licence` you have and `where to ask questions`.

Also define proper documentation for classes, methods, and scripts.
Without knowing what goes in, what it does, and what comes out how of any code, its hard for people to trust your code.
Moreover, after some time it is often hard for yourself to remember what you did over the years working on one or several projects.


In general we recommend the following sites for further details:
* [Real Python](https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/) offers an in depth guide for documenting python code.
* [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/documentation/) is not as overloaded and gives a brief insight into another tool ([Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)).
