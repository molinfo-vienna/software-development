# The public best-practice page for the Molecular Informatics group at the University of Vienna

The official MolInfo-Vienna guidline for modern molecular informaticians to keep the focus on the reasearch than the how to set up their repository.

This setup guide is for everyone wanting to set up a molecular informatics project in python project quickly and easily.
In order to maximize collaborations and reusability of each project, we recommend making a package out of your project.
This allows for easy access to your code, reduces the time to implement new features, and collaborate with others. 
If you are working on sensitive topics that should not be public, you do not have to deploy to [Conda](https://anaconda.org/) or [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).
